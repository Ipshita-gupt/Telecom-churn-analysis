# Telecom Churn Analysis 📊

An end-to-end Data Analytics project where I analyzed customer churn behavior for a telecom company using **Python (pandas, seaborn)** and **Power BI**.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Fields include: gender, tenure, contract type, monthly charges, churn status, etc.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- Power BI: dashboard and KPI visualization
- Excel: data export
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧹 Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Churn Rate Calculation
- Feature-wise churn comparison (e.g., by contract, monthly charges)
- Dashboard creation in Power BI

## 📊 Key Insights
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** and **high monthly charges** were more likely to churn
- Churn rate was around **26.5%**
- Long-tenure customers are more likely to stay
